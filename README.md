# Quantum-Binary-Classifier
A personal project of mine. The goal is to get a quantum binary classifier to score as high
as possible on the credit risk dataset. Near term goals are to have it attempt to beat some
basic models, such as linear regression and basic decision trees. Fail this, score at 
least 90% accuracy on a balanced test set by the end of the year.
